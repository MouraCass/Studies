# JavaScript Array Methods

## Remove Character from a String:

### - replace(): The replace method is used to replace a specific character/string with other character/string. It takes two parameters, first is the string to be replaced and the second is the string which is to be replaced with.


### - replace() method with a regular expression: This method is used to remove all occurrences of the specified character, unlike the previous method.


### - slice(): The slice() method is used to extract parts of a string between the given parameters. This method takes the starting index and the ending index of the string and returns the string in between these indices. If the ending index is not specified, it is assumed to be the length of the string.

## Math() object:

 ### - Math.abs() :  The Math.abs( number ) function returns the absolute value of a number. That is, it returns x if x is positive or zero, and the negation of x if x is negative.
